The purpose of this program is to take user information. It will then take the password and 'hash' it for better security.
The program will take the user's first and last name, user ID, and password.
The program will then display the user's information, using the hashed password instead of the one the user gave.

#1. Prompt the user to enter their first name

#2. Prompt the user to enter their last name

#3. Prompt the user to enter a userid

#4. Prompt the user to enter a password 
    password = input('Enter your password: ') + id

#5. Hash the password using the userid for "salt" and replace the old password (for better security)
